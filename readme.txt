this folder will contain sign in , sign in with google, sign up , sign out , 
and visiting  page only if user is authorized cuz lets say i make a page which
will have link to sign in page and home page ( the page we go after signing in )

then from home we must be able to go there but if we sign out , then from
sign in page  , we mustn't be able to go there


another check for this will be that from home page we will have a sign out
button aswell as link to going to sign in page so that we can check if from
ther can go to that auth required page cuz even if we r on sign in page were are
already signed  in so we must be able to go there so yeah all edge cases checked .
